# calculator
calulator is a python module to interpret simple mathematical formulas.
- point before the line calculation is observed
- brackets are possible
- Functions like sqrt are possible
- predefined variables such as PI are available
- Calculation results can be stored in variables

Example     
```
            2+3         => 5
            2+3*2       => 8
            (2+3)*2     => 10
            sqrt(16)    => 4
            a=2+5       => 7
            a           => 7
            b=a*2       => 14
            b           => 14
            a+b         => 21
